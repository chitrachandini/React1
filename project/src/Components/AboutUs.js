            <h5 className="center">About original movie posters</h5>
            <p>Vintage Original Movie Posters have become extremely collectible and have come to be considered "true art" with great investment potential. With no signs of letting up, collectors and investors all over the world have driven the market with unprecedented demand over the last several years.</p>
            <p>Most movie posters were printed in very limited quantities and all of them were not meant to be saved. After their initial use they were supposed to be returned to the studio or destroyed. Posters especially from the 1950's through the 1980's have become very popular. Many titles have skyrocketed in value and have been and continue to be an excellent investment. Unlike other investments, you can actually display and enjoy your vintage posters</p>
            <p>Please be aware that most original movie posters issued before the mid 1980's were issued FOLDED (over 95%). They were shipped to theaters this way inside film cans. This is not considered a defect. Vintage rolled posters do exist, however they are extremely rare. We can have any folded poster Linen Backed (an archival conservation and restoration method) which will make the fold lines virtually disappear and make it appear to be in "like new" condition.</p>
